I have begun training to run a yet-to-be determined 5k using the Mayo Clinic's training guide which is largely based upon interval training. It's hard work but feels good. Today I ran 2.5 miles in 30 minutes. For every post/day I plan to post a picture from that day; however today I forget so no picture today.
